I presented Digital Muqtabas at DiXiT's second convention that took place in Cologne between 14--18 March, delivering a paper titled: "The journal *al-Muqtabas* between Shamela.ws, HathiTrust, and GitHub: producing open, collaborative, and fully-referencable digital editions of early Arabic periodicalsâ€”with almost no funds".
